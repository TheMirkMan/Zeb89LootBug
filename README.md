the amount of pain i've been through trying to change only one mp3 and after discovering i could do everything with "CustomSounds" is uninmaginable.
This mod Replaces the loot bug sounds with some clips of famous arezzo's youtuber zeb89.
as of now the mod is incomplete, it still needs 2(or 3) audio files, unfortunately i don't think i can finish it today. still publish it tho.
i accept suggestions on what other sentences that can be used.
